# cmdlib

A tiny library for handling commands for bots made using [irc-framework](https://github.com/kiwiirc/irc-framework).

Mostly on GitHub for (probably) easier type stuff and to not have to copy it into the bot's code. Not really meant for other people to use (at least, not yet).

## Usage

Add it as a dependency manually, then `npm install`.

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"cmdlib": "CST1229/cmdlib#master"
	}
}

```

There isn't much documentation as it's not really meant for other people to use (though I do allow doing so), but you can read the code (it has some JSDoc).
